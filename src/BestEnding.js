<text ><strong style={{fontSize:'22px'}}>Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰</strong> You got the Best Ending. If the game were completed, players would have received this ending if they got high credibility points based on the type of content they shared in total.

You got this ending by sharing the Verona Times article. In a nutshell, it was the most unbiased article that featured a government report to supplement its claims. The publisher was also a third-party separated from involvement from the actual event itself.

Both Capulets and Montagues news companies are pressured to reform their ways of conducting news for the greater good in order to repair their now soiled reputations.
