You got this ending by sharing the <strong>Montague News article.</strong> In a nutshell, screenshots of claims are unreliable since there generally isn’t enough information to make an informed opinion. It is also fairly easy to manipulate. The overall language skews towards the Montagues (since some of their employees were involved in the event) and it is written to invoke strong emotions from its viewers in order to have it shared.

<br></br>
Due to the strong hate and distrust from both families at each other, Romeo and Juliet’s relationship was met with huge scrutiny and disapproval. Many of the general public even speculated it was an attempt to get higher audience engagement for both companies. The couple splits up over the pressure, with Romeo disappearing from social media and Juliet’s new poetry book bombing upon release.
